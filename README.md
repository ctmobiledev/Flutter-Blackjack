# Flutter-Blackjack

A simplified game of Blackjack as a basic demonstration of Flutter and Dart.


## Description

This app is the first app I used to learn how to write for Flutter using Dart.  
The Blackjack game represented is a simplified version, so there's no splitting
of hands, no insurance bets, or any of the fancy stuff. This also presumes an 
infinite "shoe" of multiple decks of cards so forget about card counting.

This project turned out to be a decent working model of a number of different 
Flutter and Dart concepts including detection of button press events, styling 
of controls, and (perhaps especially) how Flutter manages layout formatting.'

Note that this project does not include much in the way of modularization,
industry design patterns, architectural patterns, or any other "industry"
markers. That was not the point of it. As this was a first project, my goal
was to get the vision from my head to an executable as quickly as possible,
while learning the idiosyncrasies and benefits of working with Flutter and the
Dart language, both under the Visual Studio Code extension for Flutter.
